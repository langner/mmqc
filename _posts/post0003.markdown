Yes and no. For some time I've had an urge to blog. I follow quite a few and most are concerned with science and research, or with computing and programming. Regularly I stumble upon technical information on blogs that I find helpful in my work. In a way, this website is about me giving back to that community. It's also about organizing the various technical notes I've put down in many places.

Strictly speaking I will retain the core features of a blog, namely reverse-chronological order and some form of commenting. The infrastructure, however, is based on [Blogofile](http://www.blogofile.com), which is a static website compiler written in Python, and the ubiquitous [git revision control system](http://git-scm.com). In fact, I've decided to version control the whole source code for the website and [to publish it openly on github](https://github.com/langner/mmqc).

I will refer to the things I write here as *notes*, and not posts as in typical blogs, because most will be technical and short, and they will probably be published irregularly. Also, I might go back and update, change, correct and extend notes in the future. But since the source is versioned, it is also possible to go back in time if needed.
