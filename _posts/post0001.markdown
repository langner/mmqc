I'm involved in the development of [cclib](http://cclib.sourceforge.net "cclib website"), which is a Python library for parsing computational chemistry output files, and progress has been sporadic at best. Nonetheless, after a few years the version number is above 1.0, the interface is quite stable and most of the commits now are bugfixes. More importantly, it seems we have acquired quite a bit of users, especially via [GaussSum](http://gausssum.sourceforge.net/ "GaussSum") and [QMForge](http://qmforge.sourceforge.net/ QMForge), which are basically graphical user interfaces for cclib. This year I decided it is time to finally introduce cclib into [Debian](http://www.debian.org "Debian"), my Linux distribution of choice.

Although I've used Debian for many years, I've never built packages or maintained them. My entry points were the [debichem packaging group](http://debichem.alioth.debian.org/ "Debichem"), the [Debian mentors website](http://mentors.debian.net "mentors.debian.net"), and of course the [maintainer's guide](http:///www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/ "Debian new maintainer's guide"). All these were very helpful in getting the job done efficiently.

So, I'm happy to report that Debian users (of the current testing distribution, aka *wheezy*) can install cclib even easier than before, by typing one command at the terminal:

$$code(lang=bash)
aptitude install cclib
$$/code

or via their favorite software package manager. This actually installs two packages, [python-cclib](http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/python-cclib "python-cclib in wheezy") containing the core Python module, and [cclib](http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/cclib "cclib in wheezy") which carries the user scripts. Due to current and possible future conflicts in names, these user scripts have prefixed with *cclib-*; that means that instead of *ccget* users run *cclib-ccget* and that *cda* has been changed to *cclib-cda*.

If you are also interested in the logfiles distributed with cclib and the accompanying unittests, you will need to install [cclib-data](http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/cclib-data "cclib-data in wheezy") from the *non-free* repository. This is due to copyright issues, since the log files created by many computational chemistry programs are not free to use and distribute under all conditions (see [debichem-devel mailing list from July 2011](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/debichem-devel/2011-July/thread.html "debichem-devel July 2011") for the relevant discussion).

Using cclib within Python is the same as always. For examples, with all packages installed you can type this in the interpreter:

$$code(lang=python)
>> import cclib
>> cclib.test.testall()
$$/code

which should run the whole cclib unittest suite.
