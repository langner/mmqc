I've haven't found anything about this on the web yet, and it caused me to loose some data and time, so I'm issuing a warning here. Using [zip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)) to pack and compress files on a [glusterfs](http://www.gluster.org/) partition can corrupt the resulting archive.
$$code(lang=console)
me@machine: ~/glusterfs/ziptest$ dd if=/dev/zero count=1 of=test.dat
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
512 bytes (512 B) copied, 0.000357 seconds, 1.4 MB/s
me@machine: ~/glusterfs/ziptest$ zip test.zip test.dat
  adding: test.dat (deflated 98%)
me@machine: ~/glusterfs/ziptest$ ls -lh
total 16K
-rw-r--r-- 1 kml kml 512 Oct  6 13:47 test.dat
-rw-r--r-- 1 kml kml  67 Oct  6 13:58 test.zip
me@machine: ~/glusterfs/ziptest$ unzip test.zip 
Archive:  test.zip
  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not
  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the
  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on
  the last disk(s) of this archive.
  unzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of test.zip or
        test.zip.zip, and cannot find test.zip.ZIP, period.
$$/code

Although the error pops up while unzipping, the archive itself is corrupted. This can be seen by copying the archive to another, non-glusterfs partition, where the error still occurs. A file zipped on a different partition and copied to glusterfs, however, will unzip nicely.

I haven't studied the cause of this curroption, but I presume it is connected with [the central directory file header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_%28file_format%29#File_headers). The glusterfs setup in this case uses a simple distributed configuration, so it is not an issue with striping, although I haven't looked into any other configuration options. My personal solution was to abandon the application that required zip, and to use [tar](http://www.gnu.org/s/tar/) with [gzip](http://www.gzip.org/) or [bzip2](http://bzip.org/) instead.
